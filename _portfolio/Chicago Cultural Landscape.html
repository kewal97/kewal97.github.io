<p text-align: justify>
 The final plot is an interactive map centered on Chicago, utilizing Folium's mapping capabilities. 
 This visualization distinctly marks three different types of attractions: zoos, aquariums, and museums, each 
 represented by unique icons and colors for clear differentiation. Zoos are denoted with a green paw icon, aquariums 
 with a blue fish icon, and museums are clustered together and symbolized by a red university icon.<br>The use of color-coding 
 and distinct icons is an effective visual strategy for quick recognition and helps in distinguishing between the different
 categories of attractions at a glance. Zoos and aquariums are added directly to the map to highlight their specific locations,
 while museums are clustered to avoid overplotting and to manage the density of markers in areas where multiple museums are in 
 close proximity. The clustering provides a cleaner visualization and improves the user experience by decluttering the map, which 
 would otherwise be overwhelmed with markers in museum-dense regions.<br>The legend is a crucial component of the map, positioned
 fixedly at the bottom left corner. It provides a concise explanation of the icons with an accompanying label, enhancing the user's
 ability to understand what each marker represents without the need for further instructions. This feature ensures that the map is 
 informative and user-friendly.<br>By including a control scale, users can gauge distances and the spatial relationships between 
 attractions. The choice of the 'cartodbpositron' tile base offers a neutral, unobtrusive background that ensures the colorful markers
 stand out, making the map visually appealing and functionally effective for users seeking to explore Chicago's zoos, aquariums, and
 museums.</p>
