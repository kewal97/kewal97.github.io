**Abstract**

This report contains the analysis of factors that are associated with youth drug use, using decision tree models on survey data from the National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health. The dataset contains detailed information on various aspects of respondents' lives, including demographics, youth 
experiences, and substantial drug use. The study explores three problem types: binary classification for marijuana use, multi-class classification 
for frequency of marijuana in past year, and regression for first ever use of marijuana. Decision trees and some ensemble methods are used to build 
predictive models for each problem type. The results suggest the impact of different demographic variables and youth experience variables on various 
substantial youth drug uses. The findings of this study have practical implications for public health interventions aimed at reducing youth drug use.

**Introduction**

Our research aims to predict the determinants of youth drug use using decision trees and ensemble methods drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and 
Health. The survey is demographically representative of non-institutionalized populations in the US; it offers a wealth of information regarding drug use 
patterns alongside pertinent details like age, gender, race/ethnicity mental health conditions. For close to five decades, SAMHSA has sponsored this annual
study that features an aggregated dataset composed of approximately 300 variables cataloging around 70K respondents aged twelve or more.

The study at hand will concentrate on three variables associated with marijuana use, namely 'mrjflag' which denotes the respondent's history of using marijuana;
'mrjydays,' indicating the number of days that the respondent used marijuana in the previous year, and 'irmjage' signifying the first age when they indulged in 
cannabis usage. The goal is to employ decision trees to predict whether an individual has ever consumed marijuana (binary classification), how many days they 
indulged in cannabis use during the last year (multi-class classification), and ultimately assess their initial age for consuming marijuana (regression).

Our analytical approach will encompass more than just decision trees. We are planning to employ ensemble methods such as random forests and boosting to increase 
our models' accuracy. In this study, we intend to use decision trees and ensemble methods to analyze the dataset comprehensively, It is our aim to identify factors
associated with youth drug use and provide insights that can be used to inform public health policies that aim to reduce teen drug use.

**Theoretical Background**

Decision tree:
Based on their ability to both classify and perform regressions; decision trees are a highly effective machine learning algorithm that employ basic decision 
rules gleaned from input features in order to generate target variable predictions. These models are designed for easy interpretation and can analyze numerical
or categorical data with equal ease.
Pruning:
Pruning is a technique used to reduce the size of a decision tree by removing branches that do not significantly improve the accuracy of the model. Pruning can 
model down and reduce their complexity while maintaining the levels of predictive accuracy. In practice, cost complexity pruning is adopted as a commonly used 
method for tackling this challenge since it strikes an optimal balance between a tree's size and its accuracy.
Bagging:
The Bagging technique is classified as an ensemble learning technique that can optimize the performance of decision trees. This approach consists of training many 
decision trees on different data subsets and combining their predictions. The result is a reduced variance of individual trees that results in a higher model accuracy overall.
Random forests:
Random forests utilize an ensemble learning technique that amalgamates bagging with random feature selection. In detail, each tree in the random forest is established 
on a distinct sizeable subset of the data and a separate randomized set of features. This approach not only augments diversity amongst the trees but also lowers correlation
between predictions, thereby resulting in not only a more foolproof model but also one with greater accuracy.

Employing various techniques such as decision trees, ensemble methods, and parameter tuning, in addition to bagging and random forests that employ pruning can foster 
the creation of accurate models for predicting factors linked to substance use among young people. These models will provide an impetus for identifying the major 
contributors of drug use among young individuals, thereby engendering the formulation of effective prevention and intervention strategies.


**Methodology**

Data Cleaning:
The dataset was filtered during the data cleaning process to remove observations with invalid or missing values. To be more specific, the dataset was filtered 
using the following criteria:
1. The values of 98 or 99 in the variable EDUSCHGRD2 were removed from the dataset.
2. The values of 94, 97, 98, or 99 in the variable eduskpcom were removed.
3. The observations with values of 3 or 4 in the variables imother and ifather were removed. 4. The observations with a value of 3 in the variable PDEN10 were removed.
5. Finally, any observations with missing values in the columns related to youth experience
were removed.

Upon completion of the data cleaning process, the dataset underwent further analysis to identify three subsets categorized for different analysis techniques- binary 
classification, multiclass classification, and regression analysis. These segregated data sets were further used to create decision trees and ensemble models utilizing
the relevant classification or regression approach.

Binary classification:
In the binary classification, the "mrjflag" that is marijuana ever used (0=never, 1=ever) column is used as the response variable, while only the data from demographic and 
youth experience columns are used as predictor variables. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a decision tree is created using the "tree" function. Later
using the testing data and the "predict" function the accuracy of the tree model is evaluated. I tried to then pruned the decision tree using cross- validation with the 
"cv.tree" function used best = 3 and eventually got exactly the same result as a normal decision tree with same accuracy after that used the the "importance" function to 
compute the important variable.

Multiclass classification:
In the multi-class classification, the "mrjydays" that is the number of days of marijuana in past year column is used as the response variable, which is converted to a factor 
variable. The same predictor variables are used as in the binary classification (demographic and youth experience). The data is split into training and testing sets again, and
a decision tree is created using the "tree" function. The variable importance is computed using the "importance" function. and finally, The accuracy of the tree model is evaluated
using the testing data and the "predict" function. The variable importance is computed using the "importance" function.

Regression:
In the regression classification, the "irmjage" marijuana age of first use column is the targeted variable, while only the data from demographic and youth experience columns are 
used as predictor variables same as binary and multi-class classifications. Data is cleaned where we used an observation 991 where marijuana is never used also checked for if 
there are any missing values. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a decision tree is created using the "tree" function. I tried to perform pruning but ended up 
getting the same result as normal decision tree so, three regression methods used are decision tree, bagging and random forest. The mean squared error is calculated for each method
for the comparison of models. the "varImpPlot" function is used to plot the variable importance.

The plot above shows a spectrogram of an audio recording of a sound clip labeled as "mallar3". The x-axis represents time in seconds, and the y-axis represents frequency in Hz. The color intensity indicates the magnitude or power of the frequency components at a particular point in time. The brighter colors indicate higher power, while the darker colors indicate lower power.

The plot reveals that the sound clip has a relatively constant low-frequency component at the bottom of the spectrogram, which likely corresponds to background noise. The main signal is visible as brighter patches with higher frequency content. The signal seems to have a high-pitched component that is present intermittently.

The above plot is a spectrogram of an audio recording of the sound made by a Rew-billed bulbul bird (rewbla). The horizontal axis represents time in seconds, and the vertical axis represents frequency in Hz. The colors in the plot represent the intensity of the frequency components present in the audio signal. Darker regions indicate a higher intensity of frequency components, while lighter regions indicate a lower intensity.

In the plot, we can see that the bird's sound has several frequency components ranging from around 500 Hz to 7000 Hz. The sound starts with a high-frequency component, followed by a rapid decrease in frequency and a sustained sound at a lower frequency. This pattern repeats several times, with slight variations in the frequency and intensity of the components. Overall, the plot provides a visual representation of the sound made by the Rew-billed bulbul bird and can be used to analyze and classify the bird's sound using machine learning techniques.

**CONCLUSION**

This study has examined the factors associated with youth drug use using decision tree models and ensemble methods applied to data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. 
The findings of this study have practical implications for public health interventions aimed at reducing youth drug use.

The results showed that certain demographic and youth experience variables are significant predictors of youth drug use, especially for marijuana use. The decision tree models 
produced accurate predictions for binary classification of marijuana use, multi-class classification for frequency of marijuana use in the past year, and regression for first-ever
use of marijuana. The ensemble methods, including bagging and random forests, improved the accuracy of the models, which indicates the importance of using multiple techniques to 
create models for predicting substance use among young people.

or binary classification, the bagging model had the highest accuracy of 0.889, indicating that it is the best model to predict if a person has ever used marijuana or not. The decision
tree and pruning models had the highest accuracy of 0.879 for multi-class classification, making them the best models to predict the number of days of marijuana use in the past year. 
But for better classification without misclassifications towards majority class, we can consider bagging. For regression, the random forest model had the lowest MSE of 1.617, indicating 
that it is the best model to predict the age at which a person first used marijuana.

Based on the confusion matrices and feature importance plots, we have identified the variables that are most important in predicting the use of marijuana. For binary classification, the 
most important variables were how youth feels about their peers using marijuana monthly, how close friends feel about youth trying marijuana, and how students in youth grade use marijuana.
For multi-class classification, the most important variables were how youth thinks parents feel about youth trying marijuana, how close friends feel about youth trying marijuana, and 
whether youth has ever tried smoking cigarettes. For regression, the most important variables were how youth perceives risk in using marijuana, how many days a week youth exercises, and
how many days in the past week youth felt depressed.

Overall, our models provide insights into the factors that influence the use of marijuana among youth and can help policymakers and healthcare professionals to identify and address the
underlying risk factors.
